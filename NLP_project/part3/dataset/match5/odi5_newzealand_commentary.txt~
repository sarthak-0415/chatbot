2.00 pm The two NZ openers are out there, Martin Guptill will take strike with Jesse Ryder at the non-strikers'. Mohammed Shami will start things off today, with two slips in place
matt: "India have had pitches which are more roads than green tops, with one pitch suiting spinners, won all 5 tosses, and had NZ bring in people from outside the original squad to rest regulars. I hope Indian fans at the end of the series appreciate how accommodating we have been, and therefore the significance of our performance. Been a long time since I have seen a string of such professional performances from the boys!"
1.45 pm MS Dhoni thinks the surface won't change much. It's rather hard, he says, quite similar to Napier. Might be a bit in it for the seamers early on. It's about converting and building pressure, indivudually as well and we have to bowl in partnerships as well. Hopefully we pull off a win in this last game
"Not the worst toss to lose, there's green tinge and it's quite hard. If we can follow the blueprint we've had going, we should do well", says Brendon McCullum. He wants to make a statement today putting in a solid performance and show world cricket what New Zealand are about
Adarsh Haltore: "Why even bother carrying so many passengers on overseas tours, when the same set of players play in every match, irrespective of whether they perform of not. Stuart Binny might have been better of playing for Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy final."
Bryce Hoggard says, "I have seen Matt Henry bowl before and he is a bit nippier than your classic NZ fast medium bowler. I am thinking he will run through the fragile indian batting lineup. 4-0 here we come!"
1.40 pm Just in case anyone's wondering, there have only been two occasions of Indian bowlers picking up five wickets or more in an ODI outside Asia in the last five years - both of them spinners - Amit Mishra, but it was against Zimbabwe and Ravindra Jadeja against West Indies. The last time an Indian quick took five wickets outside Asia (against a team besides Zimbabwe) was Ajit Agarkar in 2004
Raj Sundararama: "Manu: Look at the brighter side; for future IPLs, Binny can now go in to the auction as a capped India player."
Manu: "Gotta feel bad for Binny. Makes his ODI debut, but is dropped without giving him a chance to prove himself. And why is Ishwar Pandey not tried out? It's not like the other seamers are doing well!! Gotta love Dhoni and his decision-making!"
1.30 pm India have won the toss and have elected to field. They've made one change: Shikhar Dhawan is back for Stuart Binny. New Zealand are pulling no punches either, bringing back Mitchell McClenaghan and Matt Henry, the 22-year-old quick who took a five-for last week, has been handed his ODI debut
Cookie: "Great to see Baz bring the match home on Tuesday. Looking at the conditions today a slow left arm bowler would be perfect. Someone in the mould of Dan Vettori or Matt Hart would do nicely. Excited about Matt Henry getting a crack today. He reminds me of former Canterbury quick Michael Owens. "
Here's Ranjan spelling out an age-old tale: "Looks like Dhoni will win the toss again today a clean sweep in with coin but don't think luck with win in all 5 ODI's Indian Team Management should really think what they will do to improve our bowling attack and bring in talented fast bowlers in Indian side before not late as WC 2015 is approaching very soon. "
1.20 pm Sid Monga has played fortune teller for this game and here are his thoughts. And just in case you zipped through that, there's been plenty of talk about India's bowling, but Abhishek Purohit has spotted a few cracks in the batting as well.
1.10 pm Another series overseas (ODI, Test, T20 what does it matter anymore), India staring at being blanked again. This is their last chance to sneak away with a win and build some kind of momentum into the Test series. No such concerns for New Zealand, they've been playing like champions. This is the fifth ODI, live from Wellington.

praveen: "guptill playing rohit role for NZ??"
3.1
Kumar to Ryder, 2 runs, fullish, but this time it's on the pads and Ryder finds the gap wide of mid-on. There was a bit of seam away, but the line was wrong
3.2
Kumar to Ryder, 2 runs, there's a Ryder special. Sees a bit of room outside off, stands up and punches it in front of point. Not hit too hard because if it had been that would have been four
3.3

4.1
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, 140kph, just short of a good length and it seams away after pitching. Started just a touch outside off though and Ryder leaves with the angle. Good, quick delivery
4.2
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, 140 kph, another Ryder special, though he wouldn't want to see this on the replay. Has a bit of a waft outside off as this is on a good length and angled across him. No footwork and beaten
4.3
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, punched into the covers as this is shorter with a bit of room. Right of the middle as he was balanced on the back foot
4.4
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, 1 wide, loses his radar again, this one off a good length ball. Sprays it down the leg side as Ryder looks to tickle it away, doesn't connect.

5.1
Kumar to Ryder, no run, good length ball on off stump as Ryder can only defend down the pitch
5.2
Kumar to Ryder, SIX, there's the pressure release. A swat over midwicket and it was not too much wrong with the ball, good length on middle and leg. Great timing as he bent his knee and almost swept it away. Two orange shirts waiting, but it's taken by someone else, with two hands
around the wicket
5.3
Kumar to Ryder, no run, length ball on off stump as he blocks solidly
5.4
Kumar to Ryder, 1 run, leans into a gorgeous drive through the covers. Dhawan is the man as he runs and dives to his left, but isn't able to cut the single. It was fullish with a bit of width outside off

5.6
Kumar to Guptill, no run, 132kph, oh, this time he brings the ball in off a good length. But Guptill judges it to be outside off and leaves it alone

Jamie: "Guptill has to sort out his starts. I was reading today that Ryders spot is under pressure. If he wasn't having to try and make up for Guptills slow starts then there wouldn't be a problem"

Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, full on off stump as he inches forward and pushes to mid-off with a straight bat
6.2
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, 140 kph, probes away outside off as he keeps to a good length. Ryder was intending to push it through the covers, but then pulls his bat away
6.3
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, mild appeal as this strikes Ryder just above the pads as he was jumping up and looking to flick it away. Think it pitched outside leg, but either way it was definitely too high. Ryder must have been struck hard as he sinks on his honches at square leg
6.4
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, short of a good length, just outside off as he opens the face off the back foot to point
6.5
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, 141 kph, back of a length and keeps it tight on middle and Ryder can only nudge it down to mid-on
6.6
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, 135kph, punched into the covers as he angles this across Ryder. Meets the back of a length ball on the front foot and strikes it quite crisply, but can't beat cover
Graeme: "Jamie - Ryder's spot is under pressure because he doesn't move his feet and has been found out. Not because of what any other player is doing."

Kumar to Guptill, 1 run, full and it seams away just a touch, Guptill is forward and blocks into extra cover and they pick up a very well judged single. Played with softer hands that time
7.2
Kumar to Ryder, FOUR, 132 kph, back around the wicket as this is on a length and Ryder goes for it. It's a typical slog and he doesn't connect properly. Plonked his front foot forward and heaved it over mid-on
7.3
Kumar to Ryder, no run, fullish on and around off stump as Ryder defends it down the pitch
7.4
Kumar to Ryder, OUT, Rahane takes it on the second grab at gully! It was very full and it swings late enough to lure Ryder's outside edge as he looks for a punishing cover drive. Rahane had to dive to his right but he didn't cup it properly first time around, but the ball was parried in the air long enough for him to dive at the ball going behind him and hold it safely

8.1
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, 2 runs, on the pads and he works it down to long leg for a couple. A bit too short and too straight there

8.3
Mohammed Shami to Williamson, no run, 137kph, shortish and outside off as Williamson stands up tall and slaps into the covers

8.5
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, FOUR, full and a bit of width on offer as Guptill flays it through the covers. It was uppish, but he'd found the gap to the left of the man at cover. Decent timing on that, even if the bat face turned on impact
8.6
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, no run, good length on middle and leg as he shuffles across and dabs towards midwicket
Sidharth: "Is India bowling better than previous ODIs or is New Zealand just having some fun and taking their time before launching off?" They're bowling fuller today

Kumar to Williamson, 1 run, moves it away as he starts on off stump, but Williamson is on the back foot and keeps the bat close to the body and plays it very late down to third man
9.2
Kumar to Guptill, no run, mis-hit pull and mid-on drops it. It was short and Guptil goes for a front-foot pull. Very late on the shot there and Aaron was in no position to take it. He was diving to the right needlessly because the ball was coming straight at him, around shigh height, and with the balance lost, he shells it
9.3
Kumar to Guptill, no run, fullish on off stump as he looks to turn it to midwicket, but gets a leading edge
9.4
Kumar to Guptill, no run, back of a length just outside off as he opens the face and pushes into the covers
9.5
Kumar to Guptill, no run, short enough for him to go back and cover punch to point with an open face
9.6
Kumar to Guptill, no run, fullish on that off stump corridor as Guptill is kept to a forward defensive. He really shouldn't be batting out there, bad miss from Aaron

10.6
Aaron to Williamson, no run, dabs it into the point region with soft hands and looks for the single, but it isn't there. Ends the over with a back of a length delivery outside off
Senthil Baskara: "Why is that any Indian bowler who bowls at over 120 kph thinks that they dont need to field or bat. The last pace bowler who took fielding and batting seriously was Agarkar to my knowledge."

Kumar to Guptill, no run, fullish and closer to off stump as Guptil this time covers the away swing and blocks off the front foot
11.3
Kumar to Guptill, FOUR, launches it straight over the head of the bowler. Another fullish delivery on off stump hit through the line because of the power he has. Not perfectly timed, but he'll feel better after that shot
11.4
Kumar to Guptill, 1 run, good length ball on middle as he clips it wide of mid-on and rushes through for a quick single.
11.5
Kumar to Williamson, no run, bouncer outside off stump to Williamson, who doesn't bother with it. Went around head high

Akhil: "Last chance for Aaron to impress. So far his bowling has been pretty average and directionless."
12.1
Aaron to Guptill, 2 runs, this one he's got hold of. Stands up tall and slaps it through extra cover as this is short and outside off. Solid straight bat comes down on the ball as he hits through the line
12.2
Aaron to Guptill, OUT, this time it's taken at mid-on! Shami gets his buckets under it, well just about. It was on a good length on middle and off and he was looking to clip it through midwicket. But he had played the shot too early and looked to check his shot. Gets a leading edge which lobs to the man at mid-on who runs forward and holds it in his fingertips
MJ Guptill c Mohammed Shami b Aaron 16 (54m 35b 2x4 0x6) SR: 45.71

12.4
Aaron to Taylor, no run, fullish on the stumps as he blocks nicely with a straight bat
12.5
Aaron to Taylor, no run, 144 kph, good length ball speared in on leg stump. Rosco was a little slow on that as it beats his flick and strikes him on the knee-roll. Would have gone down
12.6
Aaron to Taylor, no run, 143 kph, spears it in on middle and this seemed pretty adjacent as Aaron goes up in appeal, only Taylor gets a timely inside edge to it as he came forward to drive to mid-on

14.2
Aaron to Taylor, 1 wide, 143kph, fires it full and down the leg side. Umpire won't let him get away with that
14.2
Aaron to Taylor, 3 runs, full on off stump and he drives through the line. Just pushed it down the ground with a straight bat and makes sure it beat's Aaron's dive to the right. Neat strike, wasn't looking to hit it too hard at all

KJ: "eerily similar to the last game. Last game India were too slow at the top of the order before coming right at the end but leaving themselevs 20-30 runs short. Predict the same for NZ this game - they can't always rely on someone going beserk at the end. 3-1 series result for me."

49.1
Mohammed Shami to Neesham, SIX, gifts a full toss on off stump and he smacks it over deep midwicket. Flat, hard and monstrously hit. An orange shirt leans over the balcony to try and pluck some cash, dangerous stuff, if not for his mate clinging onto his trousers and balancing him

49.6
Mohammed Shami to Neesham, 1 bye, looks to try something cute as he moves right across outside off and tries to scoop this full length ball over fine leg. Would have done better to stay in his crease and belt that through the covers. Ronchi sneaks in a bye and that ends a pretty solid batting performance by New Zealand
5.30 pm Nothing new to report here. India elected to bowl, Ross Taylor and Kane Williamson waded into the bowling in the middle overs, India leak a few runs in the death overs while searching for the yorkers and their batsmen will have to score 300-plus again. Williamson now holds the record for the most runs by a NZ batsman in a bilateral series, with five consecutive fifties and his footwork was quite sublime both against spin and pace. Taylor consistency shines through again, driving and cutting and pulling out that patented slog sweep en route to a well-paced century, his 10th in ODIs. Join us in about half-an-hour as India gear up for another tough chase
Imtiaz Muhsin: "The NZ scorecard makes interesting reading of accelerating strike rates. Guptil who batted at No 1 shows a strike rate of 45 and this accelerates up to Ronchi, batsman No 7 with a strike rate of 220!"
zameer: "Except Kohli, All the bowlers gave away 6+ RPO, what a consistent performance keep it up bowlers lol :-)"
