So we just need that foundation!"

42.3
NL McCullum to Jadeja, 1 run, dropped Jadeja given the kind of ball to go after, and he does, and is lucky not to hole out to Southee at long-on as he converges on it before letting this one drop
42.4
NL McCullum to Ashwin, 1 bye, missed stumping what are you doing NZ? now Ronchi misses a dolly of a stumping as Ashwin advances down the track but plays the wrong line

Bennett back in. He has been quite outstanding so far, but can he produce some more for NZ?
43.1
Bennett to Jadeja, no run, begins with a short one which has Jadeja trying in vain to ramp it over the slips
43.2
Bennett to Jadeja, FOUR, short and slanting away as Jadeja is able to get under this and ramp it wide of third man to the rope. Third man puts in a hopeful dive, but that is exactly what it was... hopeful
43.3
Bennett to Jadeja, no run, full and on the pads as Jadeja had no idea where that had gone, but he still goes for the run when he sees Ashwin hustling to the other end, who puts in a dive as he sees the close in fielder make an under-arm attempt at the striker's end.
43.4
Bennett to Jadeja, 1 run, ends up fending away this latest one from Bennett to the leg side, and is able to sneak in quick single as the ball comes to a dead stop away from any close in fielders
43.5
Bennett to Ashwin, 1 wide, follows Ashwin as he sees him backing away to the leg side, with Ashwin trying to help this over the keeper, but Bowden then surprises most by calling it a wide, it looks like it may have called though because of the height, which is definitely a fair call upon viewing the replay
43.5
Bennett to Ashwin, no run, another short one which Ashwin tries in vain to ramp, but is not able to
43.6
Bennett to Ashwin, 1 run, low full toss outside off which is worked away down to midwicket for one

44.1
NL McCullum to Ashwin, SIX, Ashwin where did that come from? He just steps down the track to heave Nathan well over the corporate boxes for a fantastic six! This one just seemed to climb and climb
44.2
NL McCullum to Ashwin, 1 run, now sensibly taps this one away to the off side for one
44.3
NL McCullum to Jadeja, 1 run, eased off the back foot towards backward square for a single
44.4
NL McCullum to Ashwin, no run, prods forward to defend this one from Nathan
44.5
NL McCullum to Ashwin, OUT, Guptill. Not sure how to begin here. But. Simply. Amazing. Ashwin belts yet another one over midwicket, and for all accounts this looks as good as gone, but then all of a sudden Guptill displays some brilliance just before the rope as he catches this, with the momentum taking him over the rope, then pops it over to the field of play, before plucking the catch on the good side of the rope to claim it. Ends a fantastic rearguard effort from Ashwin, who has taken the scruff of this match and brought India back into it
R Ashwin c Guptill b NL McCullum 65 (78m 46b 8x4 1x6) SR: 141.30
Bhuvneshwar Kumar enters at an interesting time in the match
44.6

45.2
Bennett to Kumar, no run, sends a fierce cover drive straight to point, who is able to get behind it
45.3
Bennett to Kumar, FOUR, short and just outside off as Kumar is able to bend his back before finessing this past the slip fielder to the third man boundary. Inventive shot that from Bhuvi
45.4
Bennett to Kumar, OUT, back of a length and Kumar has no choice but to go after it, but doesn't quite get enough meat on it as this spoons harmlessly over to the long-on area, with mid-on doubling back to claim this one
B Kumar c NL McCullum b Bennett 4 (5m 3b 1x4 0x6) SR: 133.33
Shami is the new man for India
And with those two quick wickets NZ will be feeling a little more at ease with proceedings. Still not a done deal for India though, as they can still pull off victory, depending on how they handle the pressure, of course
45.5
Bennett to Jadeja, 1 run, backs away to get in line with this leg side bound delivery before working it away down to long-on for a single
45.6

46.2
McClenaghan to Mohammed Shami, no run, Shami fails to tonk this fuller one as it continues on to the keeper
46.3

46.4
McClenaghan to Jadeja, SIX, right up in the blockhole as Jadeja is able to find enough leverage to clear long-on with the cleanest of strikes. Just what India required at this point as he knew it straightaway upon the ball leaving his bat
46.5
McClenaghan to Jadeja, no run, and Jadeja almost gets himself out next ball as McClenaghan favours the slower bouncer this time, with Jadeja having to work this fine towards the keeper as he was cramped for space, but lucky in that the ball died before it reached Ronchi
46.6
McClenaghan to Jadeja, no run, McClenaghan pleads his case while Ronchi looks increasingly bemused. They are still fighting. Fires in a short one which Jadeja seems to have hit as it went through to the keeper, but the umpire has decided not to give it out. Replays, however, show that it was indeed white as both HotSpot and Snicko are showing some positive readings in favour of the bowling side

47.1
Anderson to Mohammed Shami, no run, back of a length and wide as Shami fails to put this away
47.2
Anderson to Mohammed Shami, no run, goes for the big heave but ends up missing this length ball outside off
47.3
Anderson to Mohammed Shami, 1 run, slower bouncer outside off which is played with soft hands as Kane is on it again, throwing an under-arm throw which again misses. That is his second chance in as many overs
47.4
Anderson to Jadeja, 1 run, slaps this short of a length ball away towards long-off
47.5
Anderson to Mohammed Shami, OUT, another slower bouncer from Anderson has helped him to a maiden five-wicket haul as Shami, looking for quick runs, ends up hitting this straight up in the air, with point getting under it to take a straightforward catch. NZ on top now as Varun Aaron joins the party
Mohammed Shami c Williamson b Anderson 2 (11m 7b 0x4 0x6) SR: 28.57
47.6
Anderson to Jadeja, no run, tries out another shorter one outside off as Jadeja tries in vain to ramp this over the slips

India still need 29 off 12, but only have the one wicket in hand. Jadeja is the player to keep an eye on
48.1
McClenaghan to Aaron, 1 run, Aaron does the first job of getting himself to the other end with a glance to the leg side with soft hands
48.2
McClenaghan to Jadeja, SIX, Jadeja you beauty! Is able to get under this fuller one from McClenaghan as he clears his front leg before tonking him over midwicket for a huge six
48.3
McClenaghan to Jadeja, 1 run, dropped Jadeja given a shorter one to go after, and he does, hitting this well over to third man, and Bennett, who is stationed there, comes in to try and take it, but ends up bobbling it as he dives
Also brings up Jadeja's fifty as well. Well played young man
48.4
McClenaghan to Aaron, 1 run, Aaron able to find a single with a dab to the leg side, with Jadeja running like Bolt to the other end
48.5
McClenaghan to Jadeja, 1 wide, slow bouncer from McClenaghan which has been called wide by the umpire, much to the frustration of the big unit, who has some choice words
48.5
McClenaghan to Jadeja, 1 run, another short one as Jadeja goes after it, not totally in control, but still able to land this pull safely in the square leg region
48.6
McClenaghan to Aaron, no run, back of a length outside off as Aaron has a flash at it, but doesn't quite get bat on ball
Dan: "110 runs since Dhoni got out and I thought the game was over.."

RA Jadeja	  	51* (39b 3x4 3x6)	    	CJ Anderson	  	9-1-46-5
Anderson, who achieved a maiden five-wicket haul just before, will bowl this final over
So the equation is now 18 off 6 with one wicket remaining. Still heavily in NZ's favour, but stranger things have happened...
49.1
Anderson to Jadeja, FOUR, back of a length and just clubbed away by Jadeja to the deep midwicket boundary. Just what India needed. Anderson now under pressure for the remainder of the over
49.2
Anderson to Jadeja, 1 wide, Jadeja thought about shuffling to the leg side, but decides to hold his ground as he sees this short ball slanting down the leg side. Umpire calls a wide, and NZ have a hissy fit
49.2
Anderson to Jadeja, no run, backs away but cannot connect as he goes for a hard slap over the covers. Still need 13 off 4
49.3
Anderson to Jadeja, no run, backs away but realises the angle is closing in on him as he opens the face to run this to third man, but refuses the single. Looks like he has learned from El Capitano
49.4
Anderson to Jadeja, 1 wide, an attempted yorker speared down the leg side as he gets well out of its way, with the umpire calling yet another wide
49.4
Anderson to Jadeja, FOUR, back of a length as Jadeja improvises a flick that he is able to maneuver to the vacant fine leg region for four
49.5
Anderson to Jadeja, SIX, Jadeja has just transcended a level as he simply hammers this short of a length ball right over the midwicket boundary for a six. The Indian contingent in the crowd go berserk. Now they need just 2 off 1. Can we possibly get a tied game now?
The NZ think tank are going through the field. Just 2 off 1 now. Amazing stuff
49.6
Anderson to Jadeja, 1 run, and Jadeja succeeds in getting the tying run as he works this fuller one away towards mid-off, with silly mid-off cutting it off, but unable to stop the single. They don't bother to go back for the second as they know they are still in the series
And so ends a terrific encounter between these two, with the result being a tie despite NZ racking up a daunting 314 in the first innings. Rohit and Dhawan got the show off to a blazing start, then it was left to the integral middle-order of Raina and Dhoni to try and stabilise things after some wickets fell in a cluster. It finally ended with some outstanding striking from Ashwin and Jadeja. So as it stands New Zealand still lead the five-match ODI series 2-0, and India will be buoyed by the fact that they still remain very much in the series, and even though they can not win it outright, they can still save face and square the series. So till the 4th ODI, which will be held on January 28 in Hamilton, this is Rohan Sharma signing off for ESPNcricinfo on behalf of the scorer, Sanjay Murari.
Ravindra Jadeja, Man of the Match: I feel very happy because I have done something for the team. I just wanted to play till the last ball, but unfortunately we didn't cross the line, but we have learned a lot from this game. I think we bowled well, but the straight boundaries are very short.
MS Dhoni, India captain: I think we batted well. But if we are to pick situations where we could have closed the game quite comprehensively, those were the situations we did not grab. It is a bit disappointing, but overall a good result as it keeps us alive in the series. Even if we can't win it, we can go for the draw. I think the straight boundaries were quite short, and even the bowlers who bowled quick, their strengths are all about going full and going for yorkers, and when it doesn't then it tends to be hit down the ground. I think overall 300 would have been fantastic, and we had a chance but we couldn't quite do it. I had faith in them (Ashwin and Jadeja), but my problems started when Jadeja told Bhuvi what he needs to do. Ashwin should have batted till the end, but this is also the first time he was put into a position like this. I definitely feel like he is someone who can definitely bat like a batsman, and has improved his power hitting as well, which he has been working on.
Brendon McCullum, NZ captain: I thought it was a brilliant game of cricket. India showed why they are one of the powerhouses of India cricket. We thought we had a powerful score, but I guess that wasn't the case. They did well to get as close as they did. We had a few opportunities at the end which we didn't take, which does hurt. We don't tell the batters anything. We just trust they know their games and if they play well then they can definitely get us in a position. We didn't' utilize the position well initially when we lost a few too many wickets at one stretch. But credit to India for standing up and not lying down at any stage and keep us on our toes. I thought our guys bowled pretty well. We missed a few times, but that is the nature of ODIs, and it hurt when it did. There was a bit of sloppiness in there, but it is hard to fault what was a brilliant game of cricket. Hamish was great. He has had much publicized issues with injury, but the way he came back and bowled tonight, and with good pace, he will definitely play a big part in this series. Guptill definitely stepped up and played as fluent as I have ever seen. When guys at the top get hundreds, it is always a good thing.
We will be back for quotes from the match presentation
The New Zealand side look a little bitter as they trudge off the field of play, while the Indians seem to have realised what a lucky escape they have got out of this one. Jadeja has built on the good work of both Dhoni and Ashwin as India manage to tie this high-scoring thriller off the very last ball. New Zealand will be leaving with heavy hearts as they ponder just how they let this one go?
