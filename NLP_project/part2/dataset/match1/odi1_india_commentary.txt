Milne to Dhoni, 1 run, 142 kph, short and heading down the leg side as Dhoni turns this away to the leg side for a single
40.2
Milne to Kohli, 1 run, pushes this one gently past Milne, who seems to be struggling as he grabs his left side after delivering that last ball, with the batsman afforded that little bit of extra time to sneak in a run
40.3
Milne to Dhoni, 1 wide, too short as Dhoni knows the umpire will call this a wide, which he does
40.3
Milne to Dhoni, no run, 142 kph, Dhoni punches this off the back foot towards point, with Williamson diving to his right to stop this in its track. Good fielding effort there

42.3
McClenaghan to Dhoni, OUT, and Mitchell strikes for New Zealand as he fires in a bouncer which Dhoni seems to be late on as he gets an edge on it before the ball loops over to Ronchi, who takes a good low catch. Dhoni walks off straightaway, and New Zealand's spirits are lifted in turn

42.6
McClenaghan to Jadeja, OUT, short of a length and McClenaghan may have turned the tide of this match with this over as Jadeja feeds a simple outside edge to Ronchi, who probably can't believe how easy that turned out to be. Jadeja storms off after a three-ball duck
RA Jadeja c †Ronchi b McClenaghan 0 (2m 3b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00

44.1
McClenaghan to Kohli, FOUR, Kohli seems to be favouring the midwicket region as he once again lofts one in that direction, with enough power on it for it to reach the boundary. Kohli is truly playing a special knock here in Napier
44.2
McClenaghan to Kohli, OUT, full toss outside off and out of all the deliveries to get him out, this turns out to be the one as he just lasers this to Ryder, who won't make the same mistake twice, as he takes this rather nonchalantly, while the rest of Napier erupts. The Napier crowd is good enough to stand up and applaud this sterling effort from the Delhi lad
V Kohli c Ryder b McClenaghan 123 (179m 111b 11x4 2x6) SR: 110.81
Bhuvneshwar Kumar joins Ashwin out in the middle
44.3
McClenaghan to Kumar, 2 runs, drills this one straight back towards long-on for a couple
44.4
McClenaghan to Kumar, 1 wide, a quicker one which rises high over the batsman's head as once again New Zealand are penalised for the height with a wide being called. Brendon can't believe it, but with Kohli out of the way, he can afford a rare smile
44.4
McClenaghan to Kumar, FOUR, brilliant shot from Bhuvi as he leans back before ramping McClenaghan over the slip region for a boundary
44.5

45.1
NL McCullum to Ashwin, OUT, looks to squirt this one away behind point, but hits it a bit too well as backward point is quick to pounce on it before throwing this to the keeper who whips off the bails in time before Bhuvi could make his ground. India slowly slipping away in this run chase
B Kumar run out 6 (4m 4b 1x4 0x6) SR: 150.00

McClenaghan to I Sharma, 1 run, on the back foot as this is fended away to the off side for a quick single
46.3

46.4
McClenaghan to Ashwin, no run, pitches this up a bit further outside off as Ashwin fails to get bat on ball
46.5
McClenaghan to Ashwin, 2 runs, this time goes for the lofted shot over extra-cover, deliberating taking his hand off the handle after executing the stroke, to ensure it isn't hit a little too well as to find a fielder in the deep
46.6
McClenaghan to Ashwin, 1 run, ramps this one outside off down to the man at third man, and also ends McClenaghan's spell, as he finishes with an impressive 4 for 68. Seems to collect four-wicket hauls like stamps
Rajan: "If ashwin can do a faulkner,then I can be the President of America."

I Sharma	  	3* (6b)	    	NL McCullum	  	10-0-54-0
Williamson on to bowl this important over in the context of the match
47.1
Williamson to Ashwin, 2 runs, Ashwin earns a life as he looks to clear Williamson over long-off, but this one isn't hit quite as well as he would have liked as this one dies before the boundary, evading a diving Brendon McCullum who can't quite get close enough as he runs backwards
47.2
Williamson to Ashwin, OUT, Ashwin baited to try the stroke, and he goes for it, as he lifts Williamson in that direction again, but this time Southee is able to lurch forward to take an excellent diving catch. Nine down now and India will feel their chances have been nullified
R Ashwin c Southee b Williamson 12 (20m 10b 0x4 1x6) SR: 120.00

I Sharma	  	5* (8b)	    	MJ McClenaghan	  	10-0-68-4
Southee to bowl this penultimate over. As the match stands, India need a further 30 runs off 12 balls with just a wicket in hand
48.1
Southee to Mohammed Shami, FOUR, full and on the pads as Shami just flicks this effortlessly through square leg, beating the converging fielders to the boundary
48.2

48.4
Southee to I Sharma, OUT, and Southee bowls a lovely yorker on middle to get Ishant as he plays all around this one
I Sharma b Southee 5 (14m 10b 0x4 0x6) SR: 50.00
So New Zealand go up 1-0 in the series, which they will be pretty buoyed about, while India, who did not really have a stinker of a match, will need to revisit the drawing board, and hopefully address some of the deficiencies they showed out in the middle and in the field. We look forward to your company for the second ODI, which will be played on January 22 in Hamilton. Till then, this is Rohan Sharma signing off for ESPNcricinfo on behalf of the scorer, Sanjay Murari.
Corey Anderson, Man of the Match: Yeah it's nice to set it up at the end there after Ross and Kane built it for us. It was tough at the death but I guess that is something we have to look at next game. We started off well with the ball, and then through the Powerplay stage it got a bit messy, but you expect it in that stage.
Brendon McCullum, New Zealand captain: I thought we had a par score and the way India bowled they restricted us to just below 300. Virat's innings was world-class and showed why he is one of the best in the world. Mitch did the job for us with the ball, and showed how vital he is to our side. It was good to see some partnerships throughout the batting. Ross and Kane's stand in particular was important for our side. I was pretty pleased with how Corey went as well. So pleased with the batters. It's a captain's nightmare when you have those two guys there, but the message was simple, try to find a way to get a wicket. I thought Mitch was outstanding, and I thought Milne was really good tonight, despite the injury. Yeah our ground fielding was pretty good, and that is what we pride ourselves in.
MS Dhoni, India captain: I think overall it was a good decision to bat first. It had to be backed by good bowling. We didn't' do well in first three/four overs, but then we came back well. It was important for the spinners to bowl with control, while the seamers were not so consistent with their lengths. We were in the game, right till the end, but the wickets of Kohli, Jadeja and me that hurt us. It was important that one of us carried on till the end. We could have targeted the runs at the end, but we ran out of overs. We had good time to prepare ourselves. I think a few of the batsmen played well today, but it is important that if you get a decent start you push on to a big score. It is a little easier in India to do it, but here you have to work for it. Its important not to get yourself out, but only to a good ball.
We will be back shortly for quotes from the match presentation
And with that New Zealand manage to hold on to a 24-run victory over India, who did well to run them close, but they didn't quite make it till the end. McClenaghan picked up the crucial breakthroughs in his 4 for 68, with that 43rd over of his being vital to New Zealand's cause. India's innings was championed by the ever-consistent Virat Kohli, who played one of the best ODI innings of his career with 123 off 111 balls. Dhoni provided valuable support with his 40 off 46, and while the two were at the crease, an Indian victory was always on the cards, such is the pedigree and calibre of these players.
