6.10 pm It's a pretty flat pitch out there, though there was some movement with the new ball. India have taken down scores above 300 in the past. Can they pace this innings as well and come away with a win, or will they be forced to tuck their tails between their legs and lose 0-4? Kyle Mills to open for New Zealand as Rohit Sharma takes strike. Two slips
Samir Salvi: "Indian bowlers again give our batsmen the opportunity to score a century! Let's see who will going to grab this opportunity. "

McClenaghan to Dhawan, no run, short with a bit of width as Dhawan looks to send it up and over point. A bit too slow on it as it bounces over the flashing blade
3.2
McClenaghan to Dhawan, no run, Nathan's pounched one at second slip, has he? No, he's uncertain. And it's bounced just short of him. Genuine edge from Dhawan as this was back of a length on off stump. Poked at it with hard hands and is lucky it didn't carry
3.3
McClenaghan to Dhawan, 1 run, goes on the bounce to deep third man. Touch of width outside off and he cuts strongly. McClenaghan thought it was going straight down his throat

Mills to Sharma, OUT, oh my, he's given a spot of catching practice to first slip! Taylor's stunned at how easy it all was. Short of a length ball just outside off and he went to guide it to third man, forgetting there are two slips in place. It goes too fine and he succumbs to a catch above shoulder-height
RG Sharma c Taylor b Mills 4 (20m 13b 0x4 0x6) SR: 30.76

Vikram AR: "Swapping the openers are not the fix. We would need some one on top like Rahane... I would prefer Rahane to open and Rohit to come down the order.. That might balance the batting..."

6.6
Mills to Dhawan, no run, back of a length on middle as Dhawan can only knock it back to the bowler
Hitesh: "As elegant as he looks, RG Sharma this series: caught at 3 in first ODI, dropped at 4 in second (Williamson), dropped at 0 in third (Ryder), dropped at 14 in fourth (Taylor). His habit of poking and slicing to slips and point hasn't changed over the years. I wish those catches were held and he would've learned some lesson prior to today."

Matt Henry to have his first ball in international cricket
7.1
Henry to Kohli, no run, 136 kph, back of a length and it darts back off the pitch. Kohli wasn't expecting that as he is slow on his flick. Too skiddy for him as it goes off his thigh pad

7.3
Henry to Kohli, FOUR, 140kph, dismissed! Banged in too short and Kohli is on the back foot and lays into this. Saw it early and hit it so hard through midwicket

Henry to Kohli, no run, 141kph, good length ball outside off, much better in line as Kohli leaves
7.5
Henry to Kohli, no run, 135 kph, bit of shape away as this is fuller and just outside off. Kohli is drawn forward and into a tame poke, beaten
7.6
Henry to Kohli, no run, 140 kph, just short of a good length and this moves in after pitching. Still well enough outside off for Kohli not to play at it
Tahir Shah: "A touch of Shane Bond in Henry's run off and bowling action. Hope the quality is somewhere near Bond too."

8.6

It was back of a length and pushed across the left-hander, who pokes at it with the back foot moving down the leg side and away from the ball. He did try to rein the bat in, but it was too late.

hardik: "Look at the contrast in the bowling figures...For India it is everything above 6 an over and for NZ...see for yourself...the hope for a good, tight Indian bowling unit is an illusion over the years..."

41.5
Mills to Jadeja, OUT, safe as houses is Guptill at the point boundary. Mills has his second as the batsman charges him and looks to slap him over the top. Had to do that considering the run-rate was north of 14 but doesn't get hold of it at all

Bhvuvneshwar Kumar is the new batsman and New Zealand must be sniffing victory

Mills to Dhoni, no run, around the wicket now as this is full and strikes Dhoni on the pads as he looked to flick it away. Pitched outside leg though, outrageously optimistic appeal there

44.1
Williamson to Dhoni, OUT, Williamson has another as Dhoni charges him and lofts straight down long-off's throat. Got a little too close to that to get enough elevation as this was fired in full on off stump. Big smiles in the New Zealand huddle

Karthik: "This has been a very disappointing series. I thought the tide would turn after Jadeja's heroics, but that hope was for naught. The openers have just not managed to get India big scores, they have done the work of getting in but never managed to stay in. Dhoni and Kohli got us within winning distance of the first 2 matches, it really felt like India could have won had the openers and the middle order put on more of a resistance. Then our openers, middle order, Dhoni and Kohli all fell away in the remaining matches"

Seems Ross Taylor's ton was the 5000th in international cricket, looks like it will be a match-winning one. Here's Matt Henry

Pooja: "Indian spinners: 15Overs - 91 Runs / 0 wicket while NZ spinners: 14overs - 52 Runs / 3 wicket. Even on paper we are no more strong against spin. We have seen this in recent past vs Swan, Panesar, Mendis etc.."

49.1
Neesham to Mohammed Shami, no run, short and over middle as he goes for the pull. Misses though

49.4
Neesham to Aaron, OUT, yorker to finish things off and New Zealand have taken this contest, if I can say that, by 87 runs. Middle stump knocked back as Aaron looked to chop the bat down, but is too late. The home side relishes a 4-0 defeat against a side that was No.1 when it came onto their shores
VR Aaron b Neesham 0 (3m 1b 0x4 0x6) SR: 0.00
10.20 pm So the next contest will be in whites starting on February 6th. Meet you all then.
Brendon McCullum says it's probably the best series win since he's played for New Zealand. The boys worked very very hard to pull this off, especially against a tough one-day side like India. We saw Matt Henry comes in and take to it outstandingly, there was Hamish Bennett and Jimmy Neesham and the emergence of Corey Anderson as well. It's been pretty pleasing to see Kane and Ross score all those runs. In all the time I've seen him play, Ross hasn't been as good as he's looked in this series. For a guy who's young, Kane's become one of our experienced lads and has been moving from strength to strength
Throughout this series, they've played very good cricket. Their new ball pair have been very good but where they've taken the game away is in the middle overs batting which set up their charge late in the innings, picking up 80-90 runs consistently says MS Dhoni. From the talent point of view these are the players. They have to back themselves to play their strokes but the execution is what is lacking. It'll be a bigger test of character in the Test series and it will be good for our younger players
10.15 pm Ross Taylor is declared the Man of the Match. "The win cellar's clooking very good," says Taylor after back to back award. The way Williamson's batted, five fifties in a row, has done a wonderful job for us. We play different games. I scored a little quicker and then he caught up later and 300 was always going to be difficult to score. It's a good sign that the new players come in and do well. Henry has a good future after this performance. India will come back hard in the Tests and we'll be ready them but we will enjoy this victory tonight
9.45 pm Too slow a start, none of the top order, save Virat Kohli, carrying on. A brief spurt in the middle when the run-rate was already around 10 and over, but then it all fizzled out as New Zealand enjoy a terrific victory. Their bowlers were impeccably tight, especially Kyle Mills and Nathan McCullum. Special praise reserved, of course, to Matt Henry, who was handed his debut on the back of a five-for in first class cricket last week and responded to the call with a four-wicket haul. No prizes for guessing the Man of the Match though, bet it's Ross Taylor for his terrific century. Presentation coming at you in a few minutes
Kashif Muneer: "The whole batting line should be held accountable for this loss. The openers were slow and built up too much pressure which you can't do chasing 300 odd. 20 off the first 10 overs is not good enough. Even Kohli who played well had 16 off 32 balls at one stage and the game was out of India's hands by then. I think Kohli and Dhoni were a bit selfish today and not thinking about what the team needed. You expect better from experienced players like them!"
Ganesh: "By now India should be playing the WC team maybe save one or two slots. I don't see Rayudu, Binny or Aaron playing the WC. Clear case for Che Pujara - need his solidity in the middle of so many "stroke makers". And maybe For Gauti and Yuvi, along with Zaheer and Irfan to be back?" Sigh
varaprasad: "Fitting delivery to end the series. The delivery is a pefect reflection of what NZ has done to India. Well done NZ. Keep it up.
