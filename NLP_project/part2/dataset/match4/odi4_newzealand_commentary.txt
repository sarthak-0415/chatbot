6.10 pm But lower down the order New Zealand have mostly been held up by Corey Anderson. How will they cope to his absence in what might be a pretty stiff chase. Here are Martin Guptill and Jesse Ryder, both strong hitters in their own right and love pace on the ball. This should be a cracking spell of play, folks. Bhuvneshwar Kumar to kick things off, with two slips
elwarko: "Rest both Herby (Corey Anderson) and McClegs they said, in a series decider they said. Ha! Don't know if the total would have been much lower, but the wickets column would have been higher and I'd feel better."
6.05 pm A total that looked more 250 has swelled those crucial 20-odd runs more. New Zealand have always been rather good early on in each innings and their top-order has been in considerably better form. Will they ride that wave to victory or India push back on a slower track?
harish sharma: "Binny might not have got the opportunity to bat, but he will be crucial in bowling department, his bowling is perfectly suited for a slower pitches like this. NZ beware Binny, Jadeja n Ashwin..."
0.1
Kumar to Guptill, no run, back of a length with a little bit of room as Guptill cuts to the left of over. Timed it pretty well, but a very acrobatic leap from Rayudu keeps it to none
0.2
Kumar to Guptill, FOUR, but Aaron cannot back it up. Got the toe end as he went for the cut again and the ball scurries down to third man who lets it through between his legs
0.3
Kumar to Guptill, no run, back of a length, but a lot more straighter this time as Guptill stands up tall and defends
0.4
Kumar to Guptill, no run, bit of room again and Guptill cuts straight to point. He's already playing a lot more shots early today
0.5
Kumar to Guptill, FOUR, a bit too full to cut, but that is what Guptill does and benefits with an inside edge that goes to the left of the keeper and runs off to the fine leg boundary
0.6
Kumar to Guptill, no run, good length and tighter on off stump as Guptill still prefers to play off the back foot. Solidly defended this time around
End of over 1 (8 runs) New Zealand 8/0 (271 runs required from 49 overs, RR: 8.00, RRR: 5.53)
MJ Guptill	  	8* (6b 2x4)	    	B Kumar	  	1-0-8-0
JD Ryder	  	0* (0b)	    	
Mohammed Shami from the other end
1.1
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, and he generates some movement across the left-hander. Excellent length and line on that off stump corridor and the seam away beats Ryder as he looked to poke from the crease
1.2
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, FOUR, another boundary through third man as he throws his bat at a fullish, but slightly wider delivery. Gets a thick outside edge as his feet move very little again
1.3
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, fullish and on off stump as he defends from the crease and moves his front foot after the fact
1.4
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, FOUR, shortish and a little too leg-sidish as Ryder tucks him down to long leg, who is rather wide and has a lot of work to do. Bhuvi does his best as he pulls out a sliding tackle to kick the ball inside the field of play, but can't do it
1.5
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, FOUR, on the other side of long leg this time. Too straight again from Shami and he moves back easily enough and clips it off the pads to the square leg boundary. Lovely timing from Ryder
1.6
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, no run, 139 kph, responds with a quick bouncer which rises around head-height. Ryder was shaping to hook, but decides against it
Guru: "you hit a good shot but you don't get run for it - that's New Zealand fielding for you, you get an edge and it still goes for four - that's Indian fielding, guys back your bowler you might get wicket next ball!!"

MJ Guptill	  	8* (6b 2x4)	    	B Kumar	  	1-0-8-0
2.1
Kumar to Guptill, FOUR, murdered through point! Bhuvi's given him way too much room and Guptill tucks into it with supreme authority. Cuts it off the front foot
2.2
Kumar to Guptill, no run, oh, beauty! That's more like it, ventures fuller and keeps it tight on a fourth-stump line. It hits the seam and moves away as Guptill is beaten all ends up
2.3
Kumar to Guptill, no run, fullish and just outside off again, this time Guptill is more circumspect as he leaves it
2.4
Kumar to Guptill, no run, goes back despite the ball being on the fuller side, but he is right behind this one outside off stump. Much better line from Bhuvi
2.5
Kumar to Guptill, no run, lovely line as this is full and just outside off, left alone off the front foot
2.6
Kumar to Guptill, no run, right up there on off stump as Guptill jams his bat down on off stump and finds short cover
Noyal: "fiery start from kiwi openers."

3.1
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, 1 run, keeps it just outside off as this is on a length, but Ryder is camped on the back foot as he punches through the covers, but hasn't timed it well enough, for a quick single.
3.2
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, no run, full and speared in at the pads as it hits the front one and rolls through to Dhoni
3.3
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, 1 run, fullish and on middle and leg as Guptill nudges it between midwicket and mid-on for a single as the fielders stand right on the edge of the circle
3.4
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, 1 run, length ball on the pads as Ryder clips it to deep backward square leg, who had just gone back. Short fine had come in for that ball
3.5
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, no run, back of a length and it was right on middle too, Guptill tries to find the gap straight of midwicket, but can't
3.6
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, 1 run, touch too wide and Guptill's been generous with the cut so far in this little innings. Finds deep third man and retains strike
Sahm: "India need to bowl tighter deliveries like how Bhuvi did at ball 2 and 5 of the 3rd over. If they can maintain that sort of line, the they will peg the NZ batters back."
End of over 4 (4 runs) New Zealand 28/0 (251 runs required from 46 overs, RR: 7.00, RRR: 5.45)

JD Ryder	  	14* (8b 3x4)	    	B Kumar	  	2-0-12-0
Avinash: "With Shami bleeding runs,won't be a bad idea to give the spinners or Binny a bowl" Too early to panic, I think
4.1
Kumar to Guptill, 1 run, shapes away just a bit, but the length was a little shortish and had a bit of width on it too. Guptill chops it to backward point, who misfields a bit to leak a single. India should be panicking about that aspect of play though
4.2
Kumar to Ryder, no run, back of a length on off stump as Ryder gets back and defends solidly
4.3
Kumar to Ryder, no run, good length, pushed across him as Ryder ventures forward and guides it to point
4.4
Kumar to Ryder, no run, lovely straight bat from Ryder as his front foot movement gets better. Full length ball from Bhuvi on off stump. Good, tight cricket
4.5
Kumar to Ryder, FOUR, too good that time, magnificent timing from Ryder as he gets forward and drives on the up and to the right of Binny at short cover. Had no chance and the outfield takes care of the rest
4.6
Kumar to Ryder, no run, back of a length outside off as he stays in his crease and guides to point
End of over 5 (5 runs) New Zealand 33/0 (246 runs required from 45 overs, RR: 6.60, RRR: 5.46)

5.1
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, 2 runs, full and straying on the pads as Guptill is able to beat midwicket, but he hasn't timed it well enough to go to the boundary
5.2
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, no run, shortish but not as wide as Guptill thought as he went for the cut and gets a thick edge to point
5.3
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, FOUR, one-bounce four, but the authority on that stroke was unquestionable. Guptill is looking for his shots here as this was dug in. He was quick to pull it and though it was off the toe of the bat, but his power is too good
5.4
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, FOUR, another one and this is even better! Stands up tall and slaps it through point as Shami strays short and wide.
short point comes in to curb that stroke
5.5
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, no run, back of a length just outside off as he punches it down to mid-off
5.6
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, no run, fullish just outside off stump as he defends to mid-off. Giant stride forward
Karthik V: "Kiwis with a clear plan here... They know it is going to be tough scoring against the trio (Jaddu, Ash and Binny)... Trying to make the fullest use of the very average seam bowling."

6.1
Kumar to Ryder, no run, fullish and on middle and leg as Ryder pushes forward and finds mid-on
6.2
Kumar to Ryder, no run, nice and tight on middle and off is Bhuvi as he keeps the batsman to a back foot defensive to short cover
6.3
Kumar to Ryder, 1 run, neat little clip to deep square leg as this was a little fuller on middle. Lots of wristwork in that shot and his balance was impeccable
6.4
Kumar to Guptill, no run, fullish on leg stump as Guptill moves forward and drives to mid-on
6.5
Kumar to Guptill, FOUR, inside edge and it goes just wide of Dhoni, who was moving outside off to collect the ball and was wrong-footed.
6.6
Kumar to Guptill, SIX, fullish ball on leg stump and Guptill has launched that over wide-long on for the first maximum of the innings. And it brings up the New Zealand fifty too. Motoring along are these two and their timing is something to behold!
End of over 7 (11 runs) New Zealand 54/0 (225 runs required from 43 overs, RR: 7.71, RRR: 5.23)

Change of bowling, as expected, Varun Aaron comes on
Abhinay Sali: "When was the last time Bhuvanesh Kumar took more than one wicket in an international match? It was the same with the other kumars as well. The other swing bowler Ishwar has been warming the bench. The strategy hereafter should be select a bowler after a good show in ranji, play him for a season or two and get the new crop of ranji and continue the cycle."
7.1
Aaron to Ryder, no run, goes down with this wide almost-yorker length ball as he looks to find the gap between mid-off and cover, but he can't get good enough bat on it
7.2
Aaron to Ryder, OUT, oops, Ryder's wasted another start as he drags onto his leg stump. He was camped on the back foot even as this was a little fuller and just outside off. Went for that thump through extra cover again, but only manages an inside edge that has every chance to go between the huge gap between bat and pad and knock him over
JD Ryder b Aaron 19 (30m 18b 4x4 0x6) SR: 105.55
Much needed wicket for India as Kane Williamson walks out, on the back of three consecutive opportunities. This is one solid lad.
7.3
Aaron to Williamson, no run, magnificent. both by Williamson and Rahane at point. It was shortish and just outside off as he stands up on his toes and punches square through the off side and point dives and pulls off a stunning save
7.4
Aaron to Williamson, no run, fullish and on off stump as he goes forward to block
7.5
Aaron to Williamson, FOUR, how is that for elegance? Poor ball though, half-volley on leg stump but Williamson was in perfect position to clip it straight of midwicket and his timing is good enough to beat two men chasing after the ball. No dive
7.6
Aaron to Williamson, no run, this time he finds midwicket as Aaron goes a touch shorter and keeps it on middle. That time the fielder was desperate enough to dive to his left
End of over 8 (4 runs) New Zealand 58/1 (221 runs required from 42 overs, RR: 7.25, RRR: 5.26)

8.1
Mohammed Shami to Guptill, OUT, changes of ends does the trick for Shami! Guptill was caught in the crease as this one keeps a touch low. Was looking for the clip through the leg side and is struck on the pads just on the knee-roll. Guptill knows it's gone as he gives a small nod and walks off
MJ Guptill lbw b Mohammed Shami 35 (35m 27b 6x4 1x6) SR: 129.62
Rosco comes out a bit earlier than he's used to this series
8.2
Mohammed Shami to Taylor, no run, 136kph, he's too good at point, is Rahane! Touch of width outside off as he goes back and cuts to point, but the man dives to his left and gets two hands to it
8.3
Mohammed Shami to Taylor, no run, 138 kph, it was the incutter this time. Length ball just outside off stump as he is rooted to the crease and looks to defend, but was playing all over the shot. Cut him in half
8.4

Danny W: "I think india need to get either williamson or taylor out to have a real chance of winning this game williamson is on fire this series" If they keep up what has happened in the last couple of overs, that is on the cards
9.1
Aaron to Taylor, no run, 140 kph, full and on middle as Taylor presses forward and drives to mid-on with a consciously straight bat
9.2
Aaron to Taylor, FOUR, 139kph, bit too short and wide and Taylor capitalises as he moves just a bit back and across to the off side and cuts between point and cover
9.3
Aaron to Taylor, 1 run, 143kph, shortish and a little closer to off stump as this nips back, but Taylor chops it down to deep third man with rather effortlessly
9.4
Aaron to Williamson, no run, 143 kph, back of a length on the same line as Taylor cut to third man, but Williamson stands up and pushes it back down the pitch
9.5
Aaron to Williamson, no run, too quick on the shot as this was still at 143 kph. Went for the cover drive on the up as he sees a bit of width on this fullish delivery, but gets a thick inside edge to mid-on
9.6
Aaron to Williamson, 1 run, 143kph, that time he waits for the shortish ball outside off to come to him and runs it down to third man with the open face
Mohit: "build up pressure guys, as brendon mccullum is next on the crease, with two ducks behind him, one more wicket and NZ will be under huge pressure"

It's Jaddu time. A slip in
aniket: "All great sides also crumble under pressure. First time in series NZ chasing and we can see the difference. India has a great chance to win here. God knows why MSD keeps chasing after winning the toss!!"
10.1
Jadeja to Williamson, no run, turn and bounce too! Gripped the surface and Williamson's cut shot is completely beaten!

two slips now

17.3
Ashwin to Taylor, no run, wasn't the offspinner this time as Taylor comes forward and blocks

To win this match we need to see the back of these two before the 30th over."

Varun Aaron is back now and it's his turn to pull out of his run-up. There are some shadows across the pitch which could be putting him off
Ganesh: "Really don't see why Jaddu and Ashwin or at least one of them are not back into the attack. Bowl them out, go for wickets. No point in keeping them for late, the match may not even go that far!"
24.1

24.2
Aaron to Taylor, no run, full on the off stump as he leans forward and defends solidly
24.3
Aaron to Taylor, 1 run, cuts to deep third man, who does well to keep it to a single. Bit of width outside off and he gets it off the outside half of the bat and went in the air, but wide of point

Rayudu to Williamson, no run, full on middle as he nudges it to a straightish midwicket
27.2

Deepak: ""I think it's that kind of day for India, where they would be feeling, short of 20 runs. I think Dhoni should give bowl to Binny more overs, with his cutters, think would be effective"

29.4
Ashwin to Williamson, 1 no ball, it's a no-ball! Ashwin's overstepped as this one was a length ball that turns away and is defended
Free hit now as the batsmen have a bit of a chat. Dhoni can't change the field
29.4
Ashwin to Williamson, 1 bye, tossed it up as Williamson charges him and yorks himself. Doesn't connect and it sneaks through Dhoni's feet for a bye
29.5

Jason: "Dhoni is excellent with the bat in pacing an ODI innings, but he is quite ordinary as a captain in the field. He again left the game drift by trying to get a few overs out of Rayadu rather than bringing back his spinners. Too late now."

Neil: "If New Zealand want to win this, these two are going to have to do most of the work. McCullum is horribly out of form at the moment and Neesham isn't in the same league as Anderson with the bat. We're a bit short on batting today." But the target is less than hundred away, surely you feel a little more confident than that?
34.1
Jadeja to Williamson, no run, length just outside off as he rocks back and looks to cut, but can't connect
34.2
Jadeja to Williamson, OUT, direct hit and he's gone! Williamson has to walk back and Jaddu has done it! It was on the pads and he went forward and nudges it towards short mid-on and set off, but Jaddu rushes to it grabs hold with the right hand, slips it into his left, swivels around to take aim at the non-strikers' and his dead-eye throw finds Williamson well short
KS Williamson run out 60 (100m 82b 2x4 2x6) SR: 73.17

And here comes the batting powerplay
35.1
Ashwin to BB McCullum, no run, tosses it up nicely and this is a little slower too. Baz reaches right forward and plays outside the line as he is struck on the pads. Wild appeal, but impact was umpire's call outside off
35.2
Ashwin to BB McCullum, 1 run, clipped towards midwicket as he pinches a single
35.3
Ashwin to Taylor, no run, flighted and clipped away to straightish midwicket

35.6
Ashwin to Taylor, 5 runs, oh dear, Dhoni was shouting "easy, easy" but the fielder wanted to go for the throw. It was nudged softly into the midwicket region and Baz called his partner through. Underarms it in but it goes well wide of the keeper and even past point for overthrows
End of over 36 (6 runs) New Zealand 194/3 (85 runs required from 14 overs, RR: 5.38, RRR: 6.07)

36.5
Mohammed Shami to BB McCullum, 1 run, hit right back at Shami and he sticks his left hand up and out over his head, but he drops it. Very tough chance as it was hit quite hard and he wrings his fingers. Would that be a turning point? And would that have carried to Jaddu at mid-off had it not been deflected off his hand? No, that would be asking for a little too much
36.6
Mohammed Shami to Taylor, 1 run, shortish and there was just about enough room for Taylor to time his cut, but Rahane is too good at backward point. Dives to his left and saves a few runs and that's drinks

38.2
Mohammed Shami to Taylor, 1 run, fullish on middle and off as he defends with soft hands and runs through for a very tight single. Just about quick enough as the short midwicket fielder, Rayudu, gets to the ball but can't throw down the stumps. Might have reached even if he had. Gee, Taylor's fast

Mazher Arshad comes up with this stat: "Kane Williamson has four 50s in four games. The only player to score 50-plus in all 5 matches of the bilateral series is Yasir Hameed, scored 4 fifties and a century in the home series against New Zealand in 2003."

42.6
Aaron to Taylor, FOUR, ton up for Taylor and it comes off a shot that has been immensely productive for him tonight. Off comes the helmet, out comes the tongue and Hamilton rises to it's feet as he cuts a short and wide ball over point and it goes of way faster than I can gather my thoughts on what to type. Chance-less innings and he has been incredible through the off side.
Alpesh: "Same old menace. When will India develop a wicket taking bowler who can take wickets in non conducive and non friendly situations. The likes of Waqar, Wasim, Ajmal, Mcgrath, Steyn, Malinga, Murali - When they arrive to get a break through more often then not they get it. We really miss such game changing bowlers all the time.."

Mohammed Shami is back
Another Mazher stat: "Last time Ross Taylor scored match-winning ODI 100 was against Pakistan at Palekelle in WC 2011. Since then 4 centuries, all in losing cause."
47.1
Mohammed Shami to Taylor, 1 run, 131, shortish and outside off as he dabs it down to third man
47.2

47.3
Mohammed Shami to BB McCullum, FOUR, this time he gets the ball on the full and beats mid-off at his left. Excellent use of the feet as he pierces the gap and strikes a boundary that might well snuff out the contest in this chase

48.1
Aaron to BB McCullum, SIX, 142 kph, how emphatic is that?! Length ball just outside off as Baz slaps it over long-off and seals this series in a blaze of glory!
9.50 pm Well, that's all we have for you. There's one more stop for this caravan - Wellington on Friday. The series is dead, but India have some pride on the line and New Zealand could win the series 4-0 if they take that game. So we hope for your company then. For now, this is Alagappan Muthu and scorer Sanjay Murari saying sayonara
9.45 pm "Struggled at the top, I think last game we got some kind of start going," says Dhoni. "We tried to hit that slightly back of a length and bowl in that channel which their bowlers did. We lost a few wickets early, but we did get some kind of partnership going late in the day but we were 20-30 runs short. Bowling was a quite disappointing and we often complain about the five fielders outside the circle, when you bowl short and wide it doesn't matter. We'll take it one game at a time, most of our batsmen have got starts but they were not able to push on. They'd need a bit of luck too"
"Tough conditions tonight," says Brendon McCullum "Conditions suited India more than us and we lost to toss and gave them a few too many runs in the end. We knew someone had to bat well and get a big hundred and Rosco did that. Mills is outstanding, it was good to give someone else an oppportunity on a horses for courses thing on a quicker wicket and Neesham has also learned a lot today as well. The blueprint of the batting shouldn't change. Williamson and Taylor have done that very well to set things up and it was great Rosco got a match-winning hundred and we're very happy. Yep, we are going to enjoy this one and you don't blank the No.1 team too often and we will look to do that"
"Just training. Bit of nets and throwdowns and it was nice to go out there and put that hard work to good use. I've been known as a bottom hand player and it was good to show this side of my game too," says Ross Taylor the Man of the Match. "Kane's been brilliant, to get four fifties on the trot. Yeah, hopefully the baby can hold up for a while and I can finish the one-day series before the birth"
9.25 pm Ross Taylor gets to lead the players off the field, what an incredible innings he played. Negotiated a tricky period against the two India spinners, and even then he did not look out of place. He was in his element against the quicks, who were a touch profligate with short and wide deliveries. It was a tough chase, but his partnership with Kane Williamson set the base and Brendon McCullum set the fire at the other end, but without Taylor's innings this chase would not have been as effortless as it has been in hindsight. Ravindra Jadeja has earned some major points, many did not think he would fare as well as he has overseas, but he helped India put up a good, fighting total and was the only bowler who looked threatening enough. Presentation in a few minutes' time, do stay tuned
Mark: "@Rohan, stop moaning, it's not about Dhoni, it is about a great innings from Taylor."
JD: "Huge and deserved win from NZ, congratulations."
farhan khaliq: "What a come back for McCullum he scored only 3 from his first 13 balls and after that scored 46 runs on just 23 balls with a strike rate of 200.What a player he is......."
Rohan: "So what is on Dhoni's excuse list this time (pulls out a book as thick as the almanack): 30 runs short, seamers need to improve, middle order needs to score and stay. Bye!" Heh, so much for the presentation.
