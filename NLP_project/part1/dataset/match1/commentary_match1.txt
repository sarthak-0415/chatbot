It's a stunning afternoon at here McLean Park in Napier. The New Zealand openers are already out in the middle while the Indians do their warm-ups out in the field as they ready themselves for what promises to be a cracking series.India have their new-look 'Star' uniforms. It will be Bhuvi to open the bowling to Guptill.
AK: "This Indian team is bereft of any of its experienced established old players like Gambhir, Sehwag, Sachin, Dravid, Laxman etc. However, the new breed of batsmen Shawan, M Vijay, Pujata, Kohli and R Sharma have shown their prowess both in India and SA. So, it will exciting to see how this new batting line up for India performs in NZ."
Nish: "Dhoni doesn't seem to have learned anything from the ODI's in SA - picking the same failed bowling combination!"
Hari: "Binny could become a Faulkner for India- he had finished games for his IPL- he should be given a chance"
Vaibhav: "Nobody want to watch India bowling,,Everybody In india woke up at 6:a.m.,,after seeing the toss on the bed again"
Rahul: "Good morning everyone. Woke up really excited this morning only to know India are bowling and playing with Ishant and Ashwin considering recent tour in SA this is a brave decision which I cant stand with. Need to use next three hours for Sunday extended sleep. "
Minni: "Dhoni is setting up himself for failure for the WC. Captains become jaded after some time and is Dhoni turning one too? How else can one explain no change in bowling dept, this same bowling team concedes 300+ in even bowling friendly pitches. Binny/Ishwar should have been given a chance along with Aaron?"
The Weird Beard: "Try not to be so harsh on Ravi Ashwin... now that Sachin has retired, he is the 2nd best batsman India has"
Nick Smith: "Great to see Milne make the XI at the expense of Mills. Mills has had a good career but seems to have hung around a bit long, possibly in the hope of picking up T20 contracts, a la Oram, Styris and Franklin...good to see promising youngsters get a crack at international cricket instead..."
Sam: "Glad to see Milne in for Mills. For Adam Milne it is about getting some more experience for World Cup where I would hope he will play ahead of Mills who just doesn't look threatening anymore."
Prashanth: "Suresh Raina was big failure again Australia and South Africa. Why can't Dhoni try Rayudu. He is been on the bench for very long time waiting for a chance to prove him self. "
1.45pm Brendon McCullum might just go with a four-pronged pace attack to blast the Indian batsmen out. Worth a punt?
Sam: "Why is everyone suddenly critising Ashwin? Don't forget he just won the Polly Umrigar Award for India's best cricketer during the 2012-13 season"
Manu: "Jadeja would've played regardless because of his good showing with the ball in SA. Binny for Ashwin could've been a good choice. Maybe the pacy Aaron or consistent Pandey could've been given a look in for Ishant. It looks like it's the same old for India."
Sam : "Come on New Zealand! A population of 1.2 billion vs 4.5 million... Time for the mouse to defeat the lion!!!"
Bhargav: "Binny better choice in NZ condition, like Chris harris for NZ in 90's"
Sai: "Since this is just the first ODI, I'd like to see Dhoni play Binny ahead of Ashwin. Wouldn't want to see two spinners playing on this pitch. But having said that, Dhoni not the kind of captain who gambles, not even in the sub-continent. "
Ravinder: "Well..with the inclusion of Raina, Ashwin and Ishant India will be playing with 8 players effectively!"
Our roving reporter on the ground, Abhishek Purohit, says that there doesn't seem to be any wind on the ground, despite it being quite blustery the last few days.
1.40pm Do you agree with the team that India have decided to play on the day? Would Binny have been a better choice for this Napier track over the likes of Jadeja?
Sai: "Since this is just the first ODI, I'd like to see Dhoni play Binny ahead of Ashwin. Wouldn't want to see two spinners playing on this pitch. But having said that, Dhoni not the kind of captain who gambles, not even in the sub-continent. "
India will go into this first ODI with the following side: Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Suresh Raina, Ajinkya Rahane, MS Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja, R Ashwin, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma
New Zealand, meanwhile, will go in without the services of Kyle Mills and James Neesham, with Adam Milne finding a spot in the eleven.
Jadeja, Bhuvi, Shami, Ishant, Ashwin Dhawan, Rohit, Kohli, Rahane, Raina, MS
Brendan: "@Tanveer: Napier is generally a favoured batting venue. With the warmth there is today, sensible batting should get at least 280. With 320, not out of the question entirely. Should be a good bat. The bowlers, if they bowl in the right places, might be able to stop too many partnerships forming. We know Kohli-Sharma combinations have been dangerous over the last 12 months..."
Jose : "For India, it is the beginning of the 'campaign for the World cup to beheld in NZ & OZ. Baptism of the brave young talents to the true international caliber. Beginning of sifting the grains from the chaff. Good luck to the boys. NZ, you had all along been good hosts. By and large the best men to play against. And potential turning point in their image makeover. Hope to see a intensely fought, but gentlemanly match!"
Chris: "Wouldn't want to bowl first - expected to hit 32c.... and if India isn't used to this climate - they'll find it hard in the heat"
Chaitanya chooses to take the glass half-full approach as people in India surface a bit sooner than would be expected on a lazy Sunday morning: "Getting up at 6 am on a Sunday morning is too tiring..on the brighter side,this can be a great practice for all of us here in India specially for the World Cup 2015 (being held in Aus & Nz) which is just 390 days away!!"
The news from the ground is that India have won the toss and will bowl first
1.30pm Lots of happy Indian fans out in Napier today. Looks a beautiful morning, and hopefully the cricket will be as good. Will have toss details shortly.
Shakeel: "If India win the toss, they'll definitely bat first... That's the formula they've been riding on recently."
Brendan: "@Tanveer: Napier is generally a favoured batting venue. With the warmth there is today, sensible batting should get at least 280. With 320, not out of the question entirely.

dan: "Tanveer: napier is a small ground and has a history of high scoring games and close ones too so expect a 300 plus game today"
Manu: "Excited to see how "Star" looks on the Indian jersey after seeing "Sahara" on it for a longgggg time. "
Amit Singh: "Well.... Napier is one of India's favourite hunting ground in Newzealand.....fond memories"
1.28pm Just moments from the toss now. In the mean time why not check out what a certain MS Dhoni has to say about his side's chances in these beautiful shores.
Tanveer: "Any reports on the pitch conditions. Also what will be a good score to defend for team batting first?"
1.25pm Wondering who might don the colours for India today? Will they choose to go with a tried-and-tested formula, or will they look to add some new blood in the form of Stuart Binny, who might just fulfill the role of a fast bowling allrounder in conditions that would suit him. And how about New Zealand? Will they look to go with four out-and-out quicks, or keep a spin option in the form of Nathan McCullum? Sidharth Monga's preview may just provide those answers.
1.15pm Welcome to the start of India's tour of New Zealand. The first match is in the beautiful small town of Napier. You can see the sea from the stands of McLean Park. Not that the blue waters will be on the minds of the two teams. A lot rides on this series for India: if they lose, they lose their No. 1 ranking. New Zealand have an ordinary recent home record to correct. Toss in 15 minutes
0.1

0.3
Kumar to Ryder, no run, once again behind the line as this is played just to the left of the bowler
SK James: "Looking at the various comments, it is sad to see supporters not having a pragmaitic look at it all. Dhoni / selectors should know what is best to do and what the best team to field. There will be plusses and minuses to everything Dhoni & Co do, but lets support the Boys in Blue. A good match is waht matters and let records and other matters take a backseat for the time being."
0.4
Kumar to Ryder, no run, gets this one to swing in from a shortish length as Ryder fends this away to the leg side

3.5
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, FOUR, short on leg stump as Ryder is in position to play his trademark pick-up flick, this time behind square leg, for a boundary, which fell just inches from the rope
3.6
Mohammed Shami to Ryder, OUT, and Shami gets him with a fuller one on a similar line as Ryder is in two minds to play this one, looking to once again go for the pick-up flick, but was never really in position for it to be executed properly

39.1
I Sharma to BB McCullum, 1 run, low full toss which is driven straight down to long-off. Looks disappointed as he should have done better with it
39.2
I Sharma to Anderson, SIX, where did that come from? Anderson just sent an Ishant back of a length delivery way over the square leg boundary for a huge six. This one was struck so sweetly that it just seemed to climb higher and higher in the air, before landing on the roof. Monstrous hit from Anderson. Ishant is thinking "Oh no, not again"

The new batsman for New Zealand is Ronchi, who just came off a Man of the Series performance in the T20s against West Indies. Can he add some much-needed runs to NZ's score?

41.6
Kumar to Ronchi, no run, once again defended by Ronchi to end a successful over for India

Anderson doing his best to remind the IPL why he could just be a hot property. Jadeja into the attack
44.1
Jadeja to Ronchi, SIX, Ronchi does not care that Jadeja was the No.1 ODI bowler at one point of time last year. He just slog sweeps the heck out of this flatter delivery, with the ball climbing so high that it almost likes he has given a catch in the deep, but just lands over the midwicket boundary
44.2

Mohammed Shami to Anderson, 2 runs, full and wide outside off as Anderson times this beautifully towards extra-cover, with Kohli doing well to dive and stop it before the boundary
46.3
Mohammed Shami to Anderson, 2 runs, slices this full and wide delivery outside off to the man at sweeper cover, which also brings up a quickfire fifty from Anderson, and that too off just 30 balls. Can he double it in the limited time we have?

46.5
Mohammed Shami to Ronchi, 1 run, low full toss just outside off which is directed towards the leg side instead by the batsman

47.1
I Sharma to Ronchi, 1 run, delivers this on middle at a fuller length as this is drilled down to long-on
47.2

47.3
I Sharma to Anderson, SIX, Anderson is in a belligerent mood as he just heaves this fuller one from Ishant over midwicket for the fourth six of his innings. IPL contract beckoning my boy!
Ishant switches over to round the wicket
47.4
I Sharma to Anderson, 1 run, low full toss which is lasered down to long-off
47.5
I Sharma to Ronchi, OUT, back of a length outside off which has Ronchi playing late behind him, but I don't think he saw the fielder at backward point, as Kumar peddles back before taking a catch to his right to hold onto it. Ends a good supporting act from Ronchi, who came to the party at just the right time for his side
L Ronchi c Kumar b I Sharma 30 (29m 18b 2x4 2x6) SR: 166.66
In enters Nathan McCullum, who like his brother can club a few of his own
47.6
I Sharma to NL McCullum, 2 runs, Nathan far too early into his shot as he ends up spooning this high over mid-on, but with no fielder there it ends up falling safely, but the action isn't over there as a throw from the deep while the pair go for two almost costs them a wicket as the stumps are thrown down. Replays confirm, however, that the batsman had made his ground successfully
Starfish: "Anderson has proven he is ready to make the step up from International Cricket to Indian Domestic cricket. "

Mohammed Shami to Anderson, 2 runs, excellent running from New Zealand as they are able to grab two runs with a hit down to long-on
48.2

48.3
Mohammed Shami to NL McCullum, no run, quicker one just outside off which has Nathan quite late on it. Needs to hand over the strike to Anderson I reckon

Mohammed Shami to NL McCullum, no run, slower ball outside off which Nathan again fails to get bat on ball to
48.5
Mohammed Shami to NL McCullum, no run, bouncer outside off which is ruled a legitimate ball by the umpire despite it shaping away slightly. Ruled one for the over
48.6
Mohammed Shami to NL McCullum, OUT, fuller one going down the leg side as McCullum ends up hitting this straight back to Shami, who pockets it low around his knees to hold on to the chance. Even the cameraman had lost where that one had gone
NL McCullum c & b Mohammed Shami 2 (6m 5b 0x4 0x6) SR: 40.00
stogy: "I can't really understand why Shami wasn't bowled out? And is the thinking to give Ishant Sharma the final over? Doesn't make much sense to me..."

    	Mohammed Shami	  	9-0-55-4
CJ Anderson	  	64* (37b 3x4 4x6)	    	I Sharma	  	8-0-64-1
So Shami ends his spell with 4 for 55, and that too off just nine overs. Makes you wonder if he could have filled in that extra over earlier in the day. Ishant to bowl the final over
49.1
I Sharma to Anderson, 1 run, this fuller one is played away to the off side by Anderson for a single
49.2
I Sharma to Southee, 1 wide, short and well outside off as Ishant gets this horribly wrong, with the umpire confirming with the signal for a wide

49.4
I Sharma to Anderson, 2 runs, full again as Anderson hits this one straight to long-off, and wants two all the way as he hustles back to his end, with Southee able to make his ground at the non-striker's despite the throw from the deep
49.5
I Sharma to Anderson, 1 run, excellent ball again as Anderson just squeezes this out in front of point for a single
49.6
I Sharma to Southee, 2 runs, fires in a yorker outside off which has Southee shuffling across his stumps before attempting a paddle-flick over fine leg, but this one goes higher than farther as backward square is able to run it down and stop it from getting to the boundary
And with that late flourish New Zealand reach a strong total of 292 for 7. Anderson was back to his brilliant best with an unbeaten 64 off 40, which included some monster hits onto the roof. But this innings was crafted initially by Kane Williamson, who stroked his way to 71 to help guide New Zealand. Taylor (55) and Ronchi (30) played important supporting roles as the India bowlers were unable to keep a tight lid on the scoring, despite their best efforts early on. No surprise as to who was the pick of the Indian bowlers, as Mohammed Shami, despite suffering some back trouble midway through his spell, was able to pull off an impressive haul of 4 for 55. We will be back shortly for India's replay.
